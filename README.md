# Sender

This is a little project for playing with some functions from the `Task` module. It simulates an email sending service.

Taken when reading the book _Concurrent Data Processing in Elixir Fast, Resilient Applications with OTP, GenStage, Flow, and Broadway_ by Svilen Gospodinov

Basically it works by calling:

```Elixir
Sender.notify_all(emails)
```

Then, uncomment the several functions to see different results ðŸ˜‰.
